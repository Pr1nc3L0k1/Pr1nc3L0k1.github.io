## Welcome to my Github Page

I am happy that you found my blog already in such an early state.  
This blog will be mostly about:  
* IT Security  
* Ethical Hacking  
* Penetration Testing  
* Other interesting/related topics

### Work in progress

I am still i a really early state, figuring out what I wanna post here.  
As my eJPT exam is coming up later this month (8.2021) my eJPT and exam review  will be most likely my first articles in my blog.  
I hope you enjoy my content, feel free to hit me up if you have any questions.
