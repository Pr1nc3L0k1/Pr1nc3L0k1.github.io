# My Journey to the eJPT Certification 

First of all, before you ask yourself, yes.  
The course is really designed to be the single and only ressource you need to pass the exam. Does this mean that I would recommend only using the PTS (or so called Penetration Testing Student) course ?
Depends on what your goals are. If you want to pass the exam, and only that, if you dont want to look to the side and perhaps learn/see some things which are not on the exam/course already, then I would say, there are some pretty other good ressources to supplement, besides your search engine of choice obviously.  
But those are not neccessarry if your final goal is to get certified. Many say that you only need the exam but I would like to throw my opinion in the pool, which is a bit different.  
The course is a practical exam, and in my opinion it's not that bad to gain some knowledge above the course itself, but you have to be careful as you could overthink your problems during the exam.
